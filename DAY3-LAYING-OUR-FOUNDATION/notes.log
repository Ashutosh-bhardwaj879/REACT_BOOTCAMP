Browserlist help us transform our code and let us un our code in different browsers
It will only work there
No that is not  the same case
whatever i write over here
This means that it will definitely work on chrome

Why does that happen?
--------------------
when browser upgrade themself
there are new capabilities come up
some browser does not support es6 yet
we need to convert our code to older verisons of browser

What is polyfill?
----------------
Polyfill is basically a code which is a replacement
for a newer verison of code

If your browser dont support arrow fucntion that means
it will convert our code to simultaneous for that

we can create a same map function that behacves
exactly same as the new map fucntion

coder does not write polyfill
babel does that automatically


Who converts newer code to older code?
--------------------------------------
Babel does that
Babel uses browserlist
Babel is just a node package
Babel takes newerjs convert it to older js
babel comes along with parcel


.pckage-lock.json also present in node modules


console.log() arent removed in the npx parcel build command
we need to use some kind of configurations for that

we can use babel plugin transform runtime console
https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-remove-console

We need to configure babelrc as shown in documentation

then we can run
our npx parcel build index.html or npm run build
we should remove the dist folder always it is a good way
try searching now you wont see console.log()





ERROR
--------
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the top-level render call using <div>. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
    at h1
whenever we have [] in create elemnt we should give key to child elemts
in props

key:"h1"
key:"h2"

but why do we need keys?
-----------------------
https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html
basically it will reduce perofrmance, re rendering time will increase
if we give unique keys to them, if u bring a new child react has to do very less work
thats why keys are good



React.createElement()b=> Object => HTML(DOM)


HOW JSX WORKS?
--------------
JSX is a HTML like syntax
JSX uses reatc.createElement() which converts to objetct then to html dom
JSX => React.createElement()b=> Object => HTML(DOM)
babel converts JSX to react.createElement()
JSX is not a package
JSX is a syntax

JSX Expression
---------------

(
  <div className="container">
    <header className="header">
      <h1 id="h1" key="h1">

      <h2 id="h2" key="h2">
        Heading2
      </h2>
    </header>
  </div>
);

component
-----------

functional component (new way)
class component (old way)



What is functional component?
-------------------------------
functional componet is a normal function, it is returning jsx
A function is returning a react element it is a functional component
Name of component starts with a capital letter
No it is not mandatory

will jsx work without parcel?
----------------------------------
yes it can work but we need to install babel

will jsx work wothout babel?
-----------------------------
no we need babel


HOW DOES JSX EXECUTE THIS?
---------------------------
BABEL UNDERSTANS JSX
