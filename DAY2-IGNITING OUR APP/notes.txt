DAY2 NOTES
---------------
1)Initializing npm into your repository

npm init

2)installing react and reactDOM using npm  install

npm install react
npm install reactDOM

3) remmove the cdn links

4) install parcel using npm
npm install -D parcel

5)iginte your app with parcel
npx parcel  <starter point>
eg - npx parcel index.html
for production use
npx parcel build <starter point>


Error 1
--------
We can get this error since we have
removed the cdn links now
we have not defined React anywhere

ncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined
    at
To resolve this we need to import react from react
and import reactdom from reactdom

Error2
--------------------------------

 @parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.

💡 Add the type="module" attribute to the <script> tag.

We can get this error after importing becuase we have to source attribute that this is
special type of JS
becuase our broweser doesnt know this react etc words

Error 3
--------------------------------
index.js:1 Warning:
You are importing createRoot
from "react-dom"which is not supported.
 You should instead import it from
 "react-dom/client".

 Error4
 -------

 C:\Users\ashut\OneDrive\Desktop\NAMASTE-REACT\DAY2-IGNITING OUR APP\package.json:5:11
    4 |   "description": "This is our igniting our app",
  > 5 |   "main": "App.js",
  >   |           ^^^^^^^^ Did you mean "App.html"?
    6 |   "scripts": {
    7 |     "start": "npx parcel index.html",

  💡 Try changing the file extension of "main" in
     package.json.

We will get this error while trying to run the production build of
our app, using npx parcel build index.html
because our [ackage.json has entry point as App.js
We need to remove it then it will work fine


IMPORTANT THING ABOUT PACKAGE LOCK.JSON
----------------------------------------

1) Package lock json is a very imp file , it locks the file
version
2) Never put it in git.ignore, you are doing a blunder
you will face production vs dev env problem
3) It maintians the verison as well as the hash of it also,
It is exactly same as that of production thats why it has hash
It maintinas the integrity
4)

SHOULD YOU ADD NODE_MODULES IN GIT IGNORE
-------------------------------------------
YES YES YES
WE CAN GENERATE EVRYTHING IN NODE MDULES,
IF I HVAE MY PACKAGE LOCK.JSON

ONE COPY OF NODE MODULE SIS IN PC

WE SHIP PACKAGE.LOCK.JSON AND IT WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT



IMP POINT
---------
1) npm init
2) npm install -D parcel
-D --> dev - dependency What is dev dependency??
tilde vs carret in the package.json file

How will parcel minify your code??
----------------------------------------
parcel is a beast , parcel uses a lot of thigns to
optimize your app
so thats why node-modules become huge



NODE MODUELS ARE ON OUR SERVER,
BUT CDN IS DIFFERENT
SO LET US KEEP MY REACT IN THIS MODULE
WHAT IF UNPKG GOES DOWN?
LETS KEEP THINGS ON NODE_MODULES


npm install vs npm i --> both are same

npx =  execute using npm


I will never touch packge locak and node_module

npx parcel index.html
