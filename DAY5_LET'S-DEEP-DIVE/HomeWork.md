# What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and \* as export?

In JavaScript, there are three ways to export modules: named exports, default exports, and "wildcard" exports using the "\* as" syntax.

Named exports allow for exporting multiple values from a module, with each value being identified by a unique name. These exports are accessed by importing the specific value by name. For example:

// myModule.js
export const value1 = 'some value';
export function doSomething() { /_ ... _/ }

// anotherModule.js
import { value1, doSomething } from './myModule';
console.log(value1); // 'some value'
doSomething();

Default exports allow for exporting a single value as the default export of a module. These exports are accessed by simply importing the module, without specifying a name. For example:

// myModule.js
export default function() { /_ ... _/ }

// anotherModule.js
import myModule from './myModule';
myModule();

"Wildcard" exports using the "\* as" syntax allow for exporting all values from a module, with each value being identified by its original name. These exports are accessed by importing all values as an object, and accessing the desired value by name on that object. For example:

// myModule.js
export const value1 = 'some value';
export function doSomething() { /_ ... _/ }

// anotherModule.js
import \* as myModule from './myModule';
console.log(myModule.value1); // 'some value'
myModule.doSomething();

It's important to note that a module can have both default and named exports, and they can be imported and used together in the same way.

// myModule.js
export default function() { /_ ... _/ }
export const value1 = 'some value';

// anotherModule.js
import myModule, { value1 } from './myModule';
console.log(value1); // 'some value'
myModule();

# What is the importance of config.js file

A config.js file is used to store configuration settings for a project or application. It is important because it allows for separating the configuration of the application from the code that uses it.

This separation of concerns makes it easier to manage the application and makes it more flexible and maintainable. For example, you can use the same codebase for different environments (e.g. development, staging, production) by simply switching out the config.js file.

Additionally, by keeping sensitive information such as API keys and secrets in a separate config file, it can be added to .gitignore so that it does not get exposed in the public repository.

It is also useful for keeping the configuration centralized and easy to access throughout the application. Instead of hardcoding values in multiple files, you can import and use the config.js file whenever you need to access the configuration.

Overall, a config.js file is an essential part of a well-structured, maintainable and scalable application.

# What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components, rather than just in class components. They were introduced in React 16.8 as an alternative to the class-based components and the use of this.state and this.setState.

The two main Hooks are useState and useEffect.

useState allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two elements: the current state and a function to update it. For example:
Copy code
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

return (
<>
<p>{count}</p>
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
</>
);
}

# Why do we need a useState Hook?

We use the useState Hook in functional components to add state to them. Prior to Hooks, state management in React was only possible in class-based components, which made it difficult to manage the state in functional components.

useState allows functional components to have a state, which is a way to store and manage data that can change over time. It allows functional components to act like class-based components by allowing them to hold and update a state, instead of having to pass all the data down through props. It also allows functional components to update the state, and re-render the component based on the new state, providing a way to manage and update the component's state and behavior.

Additionally, useState also allows functional components to manage local state, meaning that the state is only available within the component and doesn't affect other components. This promotes modularity and makes it easier to reason about the component's behavior.

In summary, useState Hook allows functional components to have a state, manage it and update it based on the user interactions or other events, and re-render the component accordingly, making it more dynamic and interactive. It is a powerful tool that makes it easy to build and maintain complex user interfaces.
